Scrape Vroom.com periodically to see if a vehicle is available

At the time of the creation, Vroom.com did not have push notifications when a vehicle marked as "available soon" became available.

This is just a very crude way to periodically check a list of cars to see if any are marked as available if you stick it on crontab.
